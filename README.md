Hacker School Live Help
========================

This project was an attempt to connect people at Hacker School on a more real time basis. The server is written in Node.js. Express is the web framework used. MongoDB is the backend. Socket.io is used for implementing web sockets. 

The system allows hacker schoolers to connect to the server, ask questions, tag them based on topics. Other hacker schoolers are notified on a real time basis when new questions come in, or if their questions are being answered by someone else. The option to follow a question is a feature too.

Dependencies are node.js, express, socket.io, mongodb, jade, underscore, markdown. To start the server, use "node app.js" or "nodemon app.js".
